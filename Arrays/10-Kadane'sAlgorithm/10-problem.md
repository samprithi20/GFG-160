## 📝 Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr[]`. You need to find the **maximum sum of a subarray** (containing at least one element) in the array.

> **Note:**  
> A **subarray** is a continuous part of an array.

## 🔍 Examples

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [2, 3, -8, 7, -1, 2, 3]`  
**Output:**  
`11`  
**Explanation:**  
The subarray `[7, -1, 2, 3]` has the largest sum = **11**

---

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [-2, -4]`  
**Output:**  
`-2`  
**Explanation:**  
The subarray `[-2]` has the largest sum = **-2**

---

**Input:**  
`arr[] = [5, 4, 1, 7, 8]`  
**Output:**  
`25`  
**Explanation:**  
The subarray `[5, 4, 1, 7, 8]` has the largest sum = **25**

---

## 🔒 Constraints

- 1 ≤ `arr.size()` ≤ 10⁵  
- -10⁴ ≤ `arr[i]` ≤ 10⁴
